Title: Simple Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification

Introduction:
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have shown promise in aiding the classification of breast cancer from medical imaging data. This short paper presents a simple neural network approach for the classification of breast cancer using mammographic images.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this study consists of mammographic images labeled as benign or malignant. Each image is preprocessed and resized to a uniform dimension to ensure consistency in input data.

Neural Network Architecture:
The neural network architecture employed is a straightforward feedforward neural network consisting of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer neurons correspond to the flattened pixel values of the resized mammographic images. The hidden layer utilizes ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, promoting non-linearity in the model. Finally, the output layer employs a sigmoid activation function, providing the probability of the input image belonging to either benign or malignant class.

Training and Evaluation:
The neural network is trained using a standard gradient descent optimization algorithm with binary cross-entropy loss function. The dataset is randomly split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. During training, the model's parameters are adjusted iteratively to minimize the classification error on the training set. The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results:
The performance of the simple neural network model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics. The model demonstrates promising results in accurately classifying breast cancer from mammographic images. The evaluation metrics indicate high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in breast cancer classification.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this short paper presents a simple yet effective neural network approach for breast cancer classification using mammographic images. The results highlight the potential of machine learning techniques in aiding medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Further research and refinement of the model can potentially lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and better patient outcomes
